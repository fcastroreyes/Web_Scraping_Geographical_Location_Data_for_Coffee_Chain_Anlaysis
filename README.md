# Web_Scraping_Geographical_Location_Data_for_Coffee_Chain_Anlaysis
Showcases expert use of Python for web scraping, data cleaning, and analysis, with BeautifulSoup and Pandas. Includes sophisticated data visualization techniques with Plotly, highlighting the ability to derive actionable insights from complex geographic data of business chains.

# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of web scraping to collect geographical location data and counts associated with specific business chains in the United States. It showcases how to extract, process, and visualize data from web pages using Python.


# Key Highlights
The notebook showcases several key skills relevant to data science and web development, particularly in the context of data acquisition, processing, and visualization. Here are the highlights:

1. Web Scraping and Data Acquisition:

- Demonstrates the ability to programmatically access web content using the requests library, which is crucial for data acquisition from online sources.
- Utilizes BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and XML documents, allowing for efficient extraction of data from web pages. This involves navigating the DOM (Document Object Model) tree and selecting relevant data based on tags, classes, or IDs.
- Employs regular expressions (re library) to identify patterns in text data, which is essential for extracting specific pieces of information (like state names and counts) from scraped content.

2. Data Manipulation and Analysis with Pandas and Numpy:

- Uses pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, for creating, manipulating, and analyzing data structures like DataFrames. This includes cleaning, transforming, aggregating, and summarizing data.
- Integrates numpy for numerical operations, which supports various functions that are useful in handling arrays and performing mathematical computations.

3. Data Visualization:

- Applies plotnine for creating static, declarative plots based on The Grammar of Graphics. This skill is important for exploratory data analysis, allowing for the visualization of data distributions, trends, and patterns.
- Leverages plotly.express and plotly.graph_objects for interactive data visualizations, enhancing the ability to create dynamic and engaging charts and graphs that can be explored interactively by users.
- Demonstrates the use of both high-level and low-level plotting capabilities, catering to different visualization needs and preferences.

4. Programming and Software Development:

- Illustrates good programming practices such as function definition and reuse, which is showcased through the custom function stateabb for converting state names to abbreviations. This improves code readability and maintainability.
- Shows proficiency in Python programming, including the use of loops, conditionals, and list comprehensions for data processing tasks.
- Statistical Analysis (implied through the use of scipy.stats):
